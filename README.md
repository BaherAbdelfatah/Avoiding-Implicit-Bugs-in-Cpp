C++ is an extremely powerful, portable, and cost-effective programming language. But it's also rife with implicit and counter-intuitive semantics, which can introduce bugs into your program. In this course, join instructor Shachar Shemesh to learn the fundamental skills you need to know as a developer to avoid implicit bugs in C++.

Explore real-world bug-causing behaviors such as automatically generated copy constructors and copy assignment operators, cast chains with both built-in and user-defined casts, undefined behaviors, exception semantics, and destructors. Along the way, Shachar raises your overall awareness of best practices for identifying, avoiding, strategizing, controlling, and protecting your work from implicit bugs.
